	* content_methods.rb: Completely changed the behavior of the
	chapter method when a block is passed.  The previous design was
	embarrassingly bad.  There was no need to use the passed block
	to dynamically calculate the parameters that could be passed
	directly to the method; Ruby has other ways of doing that.  Now,
	the block is used to define hierarchical book structure: nested
	chapters, parts, sections, etc.

	If you were using the block to dynamically build content and
	return the chapter title and file name, simply move the content of
	the block to a method, and then you can splice the returned title
	and filename into the arguments of chapter using the splat
	operator (*) or (if the block used the strategy of returning a
	hash) include the activesupport gem, require
	'active_support/core_ext/hash/slice', and use Hash#slice(:title,
	:filename).
